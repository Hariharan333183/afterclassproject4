            <article>
                Cricket is a popular sport with a long history. It was invented in the 16th century in England, but it
                was a long time
                before modern rules were used.

                It is played between two teams of eleven players each. One team, which is batting, tries to score runs,
                while the other
                team is fielding, and tries to prevent this. Runs are scored by hitting the ball, which is thrown by a
                player from the
                fielding team to a player from the batting team, across the boundary, or by the two batting players
                running
                back-and-forth between the two wickets.

                The wickets are sets of three small, wooden posts that are at each end of a rectangle of short grass
                called 'the pitch',
                which is 22 yards long. The pitch is inside a much larger oval of grass called the 'area of play'. The
                area of play is a
                30 yard circle inside the cricket ground or stadium.[1] The fielding team can attempt to get batting
                players "out" in a
                number of ways. When a player is out, a teammate will replace them. When a team no longer has two
                "not-out" players left
                to score, then the other team gets the chance to bat.

                The game started to gain popularity in India in the 17th century. The earliest definite reference to the
                sport is in a
                court case of 1598.[2] The Guildford court heard John Derrick, a coroner, that fifty years earlier, "he
                and diverse of
                his fellows did run and play [on the common land] at cricket".[3][4] Later, the game spread to countries
                of the British
                Empire in the 19th and 20th centuries.

                Today, it is a popular sport in England, Australia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South
                Africa, New Zealand,
                the West Indies and several other countries such as Afghanistan, Ireland, Kenya, Scotland, the
                Netherlands, and
                Zimbabwe.

                Football, also called association football or soccer, is a game involving two teams of 11 players who
                try to maneuver
                the ball into the other team’s goal without using their hands or arms. The team that scores more goals
                wins. Football is
